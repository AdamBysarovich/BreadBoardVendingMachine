# BreadBoardVendingMachine
This read me is about how to make a vending machine circuit. Here is a concepualization graph below. you need to make a part of the circuit remember the coin for it to beale to vend and then reset after it vends

This graph shows the full thing drawn out to where you can get an understanding. even though this graph is barebones a bit it can get the concept across on how to make them.

This is more of a intense graph showing the resistor strength and the compacitor as well. My group used this as the base numbers for each tool used in our circuit we made. There are 3 steps in the circuit. Putting the coin in, it saving the coin being in, and then pressing a button to use the vend and reset fucntion.

This is the regular circuit off and whenever we up it together you can see that everything is there, from the compacitor to hold the charge for the coin being in to the actual vend system there as well.

There you can see the coin light turned on after you press the respective coin button.

This picture shows that both lights turn on at the same time breifly to show that the vend button is pressed and the they shut off afterward as they reset.

This is a vending machine you can commonly see and this has a similar circuit in it made out of the circuit
